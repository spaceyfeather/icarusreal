# Project 2 - Creative Project

Accept the assignment using the link in Canvas and complete the steps below.  

*A draft of Project 2 is due by midnight on Tuesday 3/29. Submissions will be reviewed in class on Wednesday 3/30, but revisions will be accepted without penalty until 5:00pm on Friday 4/1. Please make sure that your rough draft is on the ETBD server before the peer review class period.*

For this project, you'll be making a creative sketch using p5. You can refer to projects in the [p5 Showcase Gallery](https://showcase.p5js.org/#/2021-All) for inspiration. The p5 sketch itself should feature some form of user interaction (e.g. mouse, webcam), reactivity (e.g. audio visualizer), and/or generative behavior (e.g. data visualization). The results can be as abstract or literal as you would like, though ideally centered around a specific concept, message, or theme that you care about or are interested in.  
  
The format of this site will be very simple and need only include:
- A header with the project title
- A p5 canvas
- A footer with your name and copyright year
- General layout and styling should be responsive (including resizing of the p5 canvas as necessary) and customized to suit your sketch (e.g. matching or complementary color scheme)

Some random project ideas:
- An empty garden in which the user can click to plant new flowers
- A visualized poem that displays a new line and simple animation with each click
- A pointillistic "painted" image in which the color of each dot corresponds to the number of foreclosed homes each week in Cincinatti (open data sets for the city of Cincinatti can be found [here](https://data.cincinnati-oh.gov))

It is highly recommended to sketch/storyboard your ideas on paper or in a drawing app first. Try to conceptualize and think through the required components of your sketch before you begin coding.

**To submit:**
1. Upload your rough draft files to the ETBD server by midnight on Tuesday 3/29.
